A novelty programming language created as a challenge to create a minimal functional
language. While the instruction set could have been slimmed further (for example,
eliminating math functions with literal arguments and prefixing the standard math
operations with load operations), this was not to serve any true purpose other than fun by
attempting a project I don't normally work with.
