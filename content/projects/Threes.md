A novelty programming language created as a challenge to create a usable language with the
minimal possible syntax. While the instruction set could have been slimmed further (for
example, eliminating math functions with literal arguments and instead prefixing the
standard math operations with load operations), this language was not to serve any true
purpose other than fun by attempting a project I donâ€™t normally work with.
